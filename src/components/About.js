      <ListGroup.Item>Assalamu Alaikum and a heartfelt welcome to Al-Maqam Al-Ali University, your gateway to learning and unlocking the beauty of the Quran. I am humbled and honored to be your mentor on this sacred journey of learning, as we dive into the art of reading and memorizing the Quran.</ListGroup.Item>

    
      <ListGroup.Item> My name is Mohammed Alqtaish, and I am both the founder of Al-Maqam Al-Ali University and your dedicated guide on this transformative path. The Quran served as my compass from an early age, directing me through the ups and downs of life. By the mercy of Allah, I had memorized the entire Quran by the age of ten. Throughout my journey, I was fortunate to have the company of mentors and supporters who paved the way for me to stay committed to the Quran's path. My drive to pursue greatness was strengthened by their constant support, which led to the achievement of my Ijazah in the Qur'an.
          I've had the honor of spreading the light of the Quran for the past seven years through both private classes and institutions. It has been nothing short of amazing for me to teach Quran. I have personally experienced the Quran's transformative power in the lives of many students, who have been led to a deeper comprehension of its timeless wisdom and had their personalities molded to conform to its teachings.
